        <h1>What is Artificial intelligence?</h1>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence( AI) is the simulation of mortal intelligence in machines, enabling them to perform tasks like literacy, logic, and problem- working. Robotics involves designing, constructing, and operating robots machines that can perform tasks automatically. When AI is integrated into robotics, it creates intelligent robots able of more complex and adaptive actions.</p>
           <h1>Development of Artificial intelligence</h1>
            <p>Since the morning of mortal actuality, people have developed simple tools to grease their work and to produce further work with lower labor. With the vacuity of brume power and electric power, the need for force has incompletely faded. The foundations of robot use are erected on the artificial revolution. still, these systems demanded the capability to make opinions and didn't have the capability to descry crimes. Independent of the developments in the artificial revolution, there were also developments in information technologies. With the crossroad of information technologies with artificial developments, robot technology has come used in numerous diligence. The following developments have led to the description of artificial intelligence and the necessity of studies in this field.

            <h1>Where are Artificial intelligence nd robotics used ?</h1>
            <p1>Although robotics and artificial intelligence are seen as different generalities, they complete each other when they find areas of use. Before artificial intelligence and robots entered mortal life, they've formerly been featured in wisdom fabrication pictures. Robots, in moment’s technology, are used in numerous areas similar as;<br>

                <h1>The relation between Artificial intelligence and robotics </h1>
                <p>
                    Artificial intelligence and robotics, which have become the basic requirements of modern life, are used in production areas and capital markets to produce more with less energy. However, it is also possible to say that they provide many contributions to people. Especially in environments that are not suitable for human work, robots, and artificial intelligence technologies easily fulfill the tasks assigned to them. The meeting of robots and artificial intelligence has been with the developments in chip production.
                    
                    As new developments are introduced in chip production, it seems that the usage area of artificial intelligence and robot technology will become more widespread in parallel with the developments of the software.

                    <h1>Replacing mortal with Robots</h1>
                    <p1>Replacing humans with robots to conduct interviews means using technology rather of people. Robots can read resumes, ask questions, and dissect answers from campaigners. They follow a set script and use artificial intelligence to understand and respond to what campaigners say. This helps make interviews fair and harmonious, but it also raises questions about whether robots can understand people as well as humans can.</p1>
